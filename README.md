# B-cos Explainable AI on Iris Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates explainable AI using B-cos (B-cosine) networks on the Iris dataset. B-cos networks provide inherent interpretability through their cosine similarity-based computations, making them ideal for understanding model decisions.

## Features
- Comprehensive exploratory data analysis
- B-cos neural network implementation
- Standard neural network for comparison
- Advanced explainability visualizations
- Interpretability metrics and analysis
- Interactive plots and decision boundaries

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook iris_bcos_explainability.ipynb
   ```

## Key Findings
- B-cos networks provide transparent feature contributions
- Built-in explainability without post-hoc methods
- Comparable performance to standard neural networks
- Superior interpretability for tabular data

## Usage
The main notebook (`iris_bcos_explainability.ipynb`) contains:
- Data loading and EDA
- Model implementation and training
- Explainability analysis
- Performance comparisons
- Advanced visualizations

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- See `requirements.txt` for package versions
